## ðŸ’¡ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â””â”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utilities
    â”œâ”€â”€ content
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages
    â””â”€â”€ style
```

 * *pages* - This directory is significant for Astro. Files here become URLs.
 * *components* - Template parts, layouts, utilities, all go here.
 * *content* - Keep the content separate from the system for clearer separation. 
 * *style* - Global SCSS styles.
 * *public* - A directory where to place any static files that need to be used on the site.


## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
|:----------------  |:-------------------------------------------- |
